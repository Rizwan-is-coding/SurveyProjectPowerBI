Used the results of a Survey conducted by a youtube channel wherein the participants had to answer several questions related to their job,experience,salary etc.       
Performed data cleaning , handled missing values, changed the data type of fields, added new columns as per the project requirement.
Visualized the data using various charts and graphs like gauge charts,treemaps,column,bar charts,cards,donut charts etc.
Created a beautiful dashboard to showcase all the charts and graphs.
